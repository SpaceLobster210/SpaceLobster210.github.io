Hello! I am an indie game developer & musician, currently studying computer science at the University of Alberta. I love making stuff--whether that's games, music, art, simulations, or something else entirely. This page is a collection of my notable works.

[Cowboy.exe Devlog - Milk Man Steve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jTI8UfcY1M)

<p><br>Get Out - U of A Games Den Telephone Jam 2025<br>
  (Role: musician/audio, art, programming, level design)<br>
  This video details a level I designed, a music track I created for the project, some art assets I created (attack animation, enemies, sign, lily pads, vines), and some programming work (player's attack and the enemy shown at the end).<br>
  (The telephone jam is a game that gets passed around between different developers with little to no communication between them. I was the second person given access to this game and had a week to add some assets to the project)</p>

## Solo projects

<p>Electrode<br>
  A game I made in Unity over 4 days for an audio synthesis course at the University of Alberta (MUSIC 445).<br>
  The game sends data via OSC signals to a synthesizer I built in VCV Rack as part of the project, synthesizing audio in real time based on what happens in the game.<br>
  The game was set up as an interactive installation/kiosk at our class's Electronic Music festival in early 2025.<br>
  (I apologize for the weird video cropping, there was an issue recording it. I will try to set it back up and get a better recording in the future)</p>

## Other works

<p>Personalize<br>
  An interactive music installation I built in Max MSP over 2 weeks for an interactive audio systems class at the University of Alberta (MUSIC 545).<br>
  I built a simple AI inside of this music software that trains itself on the user's actions in order to slowly "gain sentience" and interfere with the control interface.<br>
  I added additional visual elements such as "popups" and the flashing smile as well as audio elements such as sound effects, modulations, and stingers in order to create a dynamic experience where the user   constantly feels as though things are happening around them.<br>
  There are 4 main streams of user-controlled audio which correspond with the 4 columns of sliders & dials on the interface. (The 5th column on the far right applies additional effects to these audio streams.)
  This project uses 4-channel audio to emulate a 3D environment around the user and make it feel as though things are happening all around them.<br>
  The project had a big focus on user experience in addition to the implementation of the "AI gaining sentience" concept. I wanted to craft an experience that felt oppressive to the user and made them feel helpless against what appeared to be happening around them. Much of the project was in a way just a clever illusion.<br>
